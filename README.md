# CMYK-separation
## Description
A desktop application that can separate a given image into CMYK channels.

The composition of the gray values (amounts of yellow, magenta, cyan and black ink mixed to obtain "gray ink") can be modified with a gray ramp, each channel modifiable with a cubic Bezier curve. The gray ramp configuration can be exported to and loaded from a file. CMYK channel images can be exported to .png files. 

## Installation
After cloning the repository the solution file VideoPlayer.sln can be opened and used to build the project with Visual Studio 2022.
